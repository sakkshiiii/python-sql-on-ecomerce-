1. Tools & Technologies Used
Python Libraries:

pandas – for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

pymysql, mysql.connector – for database connections

SQL: Used to create databases, run queries, and analyze structured data.

🏗️ 2. Database Setup and Data Loading
A new MySQL database named ecommerce was created.

CSV files like customers.csv, orders.csv, products.csv, payments.csv, etc., were:

Read using Python

Cleaned and formatted

Converted into MySQL tables with correct data types

Populated using dynamic SQL INSERT statements

✅ This sets up an automated data pipeline from CSVs to a structured SQL database.

🔍 3. Key Analytical Queries
These SQL queries were written and executed via Python to extract business insights:

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Insights:
Unique cities where customers are located

Customer count by state

Customer retention rate (repeat purchases within 6 months)

📦 Order & Sales Analysis:
Total orders placed in 2017

Monthly order count in 2018

Average number of products per order, grouped by city

💸 Financial Insights:
Total sales per product category

Percentage of orders paid in installments

Revenue contributed by each category

Top sellers ranked by revenue

Year-over-year sales growth

Cumulative monthly sales over years

📈 Trend & Behavior Analysis:
Correlation between product price and purchase frequency

📊 4. Visualizations
While the exact charts aren’t shown here, the use of matplotlib and seaborn implies:

Bar charts for sales by category

Line charts for sales over time

Correlation heatmaps or scatter plots for price vs. popularity

💡 5. Business Value
The integration of Python and SQL supports both data engineering (cleaning, storing) and data analysis (insights, trends).

Helps marketing teams target regions and products

Assists product managers in understanding demand and pricing effects

Allows executives to monitor growth, retention, and top-performing categories or sellers
